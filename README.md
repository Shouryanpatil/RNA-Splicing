# RNA Splicing (Rosalind Bioinformatics Problem)

This project solves the **RNA Splicing** problem, where the goal is to extract exons from a DNA sequence, transcribe it into RNA, and translate it into a protein.

---

## Problem Description

Given:

- A DNA string `s` (length â‰¤ 1 kbp)
- A collection of substrings of `s` (introns), all provided in **FASTA format**

Return:

- A **protein string** resulting from transcribing and translating the exons of `s` (i.e., the original string minus all introns).

---

## Simple Explanation

Imagine your DNA is a LEGO train ðŸš‚. Some of the LEGO blocks (introns) are broken, and we know exactly which ones. We remove them, join the good ones (exons), change their color (T â†’ U for RNA), then convert every 3 blocks into 1 puzzle piece (amino acid) â€” this builds the final protein ðŸ§¹.

## How to Run

### 1. Requirements

- Python 3
- Biopython

Install Biopython:

```bash
pip install biopython
```

### 2. Run the Script

Make sure you have your `input.txt` in the same folder, then:

```bash
python rna_splicing.py
```

## Project Structure

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ input.txt           # Input FASTA file with DNA + introns
â”œâ”€â”€ rna_splicing.py     # Main script to solve the problem
â””â”€â”€ README.md           # You are here!
```

---

## What It Does 

1. Parses the FASTA file
2. Identifies the full DNA and introns
3. Removes all introns from the DNA
4. Transcribes DNA â†’ RNA
5. Translates RNA â†’ Protein
